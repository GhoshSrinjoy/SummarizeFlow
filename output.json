It then computes the shift required to align the mantissas of all numbers in the sub-block with the shared exponent.\n7. The kernel enters a nested loop that iterates over each element within the current sub-block.\n8. For each element, it extracts the exponent and mantissa from the input float using bit-level operations.\n9. It then shifts the mantissa by the calculated shift value to align it with the shared exponent.\n10.
