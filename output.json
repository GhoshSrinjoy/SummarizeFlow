The main functionality is implemented in three methods: `add`, `getHash`, and the overloaded operators `operator()`.\n\n**Method 1: add**\n\nThis method takes two parameters: `data` (a pointer to a memory block) and `numBytes` (the size of the memory block). It computes the CRC-32 value for the given data by:\n\n1. Initializing a variable `crc` with the initial hash value (~m_hash).\n2. Processing 8-byte chunks of data at a time using a lookup table (`crc32Lookup`). The lookup table is used to compute the next CRC-32 value based on the current value and the input bytes.\n3. If there are remaining bytes (1-7), it uses a standard CRC-32 algorithm to process them.\n\n**Method 2: getHash**\n\nThis method returns the computed CRC-32 value as an 8-character hexadecimal string. It does this by:\n\n1. Converting the CRC-32 value to a character array using a lookup table (`dec2hex`).\n2. Returning the resulting string.\n\n**Method 3: getHash (overloaded)**\n\nThis method is similar to `getHash`, but it returns the CRC-32 value as an array of bytes instead of a string.\n\n**Operator overloads**\n\nThe code defines two overloaded operators:\n\n1. `operator()(const void* data, size_t numBytes)`: This operator takes a memory block and its size as input and computes the CRC-32 value using the `add` method.\n2. `operator()(const std::string& text)`: This operator takes a string as input and computes the CRC-32 value by calling the first overloaded operator with the string's data pointer and size.\n\n**Other methods**\n\nThe code also defines two other methods:\n\n1. `reset()`: Resets the internal hash value to its initial state.\n2. `swap(uint32_t x)`: A helper function that swaps the bytes of a 32-bit integer using either the `__builtin_bswap32` intrinsic (for GCC and Clang) or the `_byteswap_ulong` function (for Microsoft Visual C++).\n\nOverall, this code provides an efficient implementation of the CRC-32 algorithm for computing hash values from memory blocks or strings.",

It takes two arguments: `data` and `numBytes`, which represent the memory address and length of the data, respectively.\n\nHere's what the method does:\n\n1. If there are already bytes in the internal buffer, it processes them by calling `processBlock()`.\n2. It adds any remaining bytes from the current block to the internal buffer.\n3. If the internal buffer is full (i.e., its size equals `m_blockSize`), it calls `processBuffer()` to process the entire buffer and reset it.\n4. Finally, if there are still bytes left in the data, it processes them by calling `processBlock()`.\n\n**processBlock() Method**\n\nThe `processBlock()` method takes a pointer to a memory block as input and updates the Keccak state accordingly. It performs the following steps:\n\n1. It adds padding to the internal buffer (a single \"1\" byte followed by zeros).\n2. It sets the last bit of the padded buffer to 0x80.\n3. It calls `processBuffer()` to process the entire buffer.\n\n**getHash() Method**\n\nThe `getHash()` method returns the current Keccak hash as a string of hexadecimal digits. Here's what it does:\n\n1. It saves the current state of the Keccak algorithm in an array called `oldHash`.\n2. It calls `processBuffer()` to process any remaining bytes in the internal buffer.\n3. It converts the final Keccak state (i.e., `m_hash`) to a string of hexadecimal digits using the `dec2hex` table.\n4.

It processes full blocks and stores any remaining bytes in an internal buffer.\n2. **`processBuffer()`**: Processes any remaining bytes stored in the internal buffer by adding padding, processing a block, and updating the state of the hash function.\n3. **`getHash()`**: Returns the final hash value as a string of 16 hexadecimal characters.\n4. **`operator()(const void* data, size_t numBytes)`**: Computes the SHA-3 hash of a memory block.\n5. **`operator()(const std::string& text)`**: Computes the SHA-3 hash of a string (excluding the final zero).\n\n**Implementation Details**\n\nThe implementation uses the following techniques:\n\n1. **Keccak-f permutation**: The `processBlock()` function applies the Keccak-f permutation to process each block.\n2. **Iota**: The `getHash()` function adds an \"iota\" value to the state of the hash function, which is a 64-bit value that depends on the round number.\n3. **Padding**: The `processBuffer()` function adds padding to the internal buffer before processing it.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This implementation assumes that the input data is in little-endian byte order.\n* The `getHash()` function returns the final hash value as a string of 16 hexadecimal characters, which may not be suitable for all use cases (e.g., when working with binary data).\n* The `operator()(const void* data, size_t numBytes)` and `operator()(const std::string& text)` functions are convenience wrappers around the main functionality.",

It has methods like `get_name()`, `get_children_num()`, and `get_op_num()` that return various properties of the subgraph.\n\n**IsoVertexEquivalent and IsoEdgeEquivalent Structs**\n\nThese two structs define equivalence relations between vertices and edges in two graphs, respectively. They are used to determine whether a vertex or edge in one graph is equivalent to another vertex or edge in another graph.\n\n**IsoCallback Struct**\n\nThis struct defines a callback function that is used by the `boost::vf2_subgraph_iso` algorithm to perform subgraph matching. The callback function takes two graphs and a result vector as input, and it uses the `IsoVertexEquivalent` and `IsoEdgeEquivalent` structs to determine whether each vertex and edge in one graph matches with another vertex or edge in the other graph.\n\n**isomorphism Function**\n\nThis is the main function that performs subgraph matching using the `boost::vf2_subgraph_iso` algorithm. It takes a `GraphTemplate*` object as input, which represents the small graph to be matched against a larger graph. The function returns a vector of maps, where each map contains pairs of equivalent operations (i.e., `OpTemplate*` and `Op*`) found during the matching process.\n\n**Other Functions**\n\nThere are several other functions defined in this code snippet, including `count_op_`, which counts the number of operations in a given graph node's types. These functions seem to be used internally by the `SubgraphImp` class or the `isomorphism` function.\n\nOverall, this code appears to be implementing a subgraph matching algorithm using the Boost Graph Library (BGL). The `isomorphism` function is the main entry point for performing subgraph matching, and it uses various helper functions and structs to perform the actual matching.",

Consider grouping related operations under a single class or namespace for better organization and maintainability.\n\n### Functionality\n\n1. **shape_infer_pad**: This function checks if the input tensor's size matches the expected output after applying padding. It then creates a new output tensor with the correct dimensions.\n   \n   ```cpp\nvoid shape_infer_pad(xir::Op* cur) { \n  shape_infer_pad(cur); \n}\n```\n   The provided implementation seems incomplete or redundant, as it calls itself without any actual logic.\n\n2. **shape_infer_reshape_fix**: This function checks if the input and output sizes of a reshape operation match.

The `toLocalString` and `toUTF8String` functions are used to convert strings between different encoding schemes.\n\nOverall, this code snippet appears to be a well-structured and maintainable part of a larger project, with clear responsibilities for managing command-line options and generating help text.",

The tool takes two arguments: `<xmodel>` and `[<txt>]`. If `<txt>` is provided, it writes the dump to that file; otherwise, it prints to standard output.\n2. It uses the `google::protobuf` library to parse the XIR model from a binary file.\n3. It defines a custom printer (`MyPrinter`) to format the dumped data in a human-readable way.\n4. If the `ENABLE_DUMP` environment variable is set to \"1\", it also writes the dump to a binary file with an MD5 hash as its name.\n\n**Usage:**\n\nTo use this tool, you would run it from the command line like this:\n```\nxir CmdDumpTxt <xmodel> [<txt>]\n```\nFor example:\n```\nxir CmdDumpTxt a.xmodel a.txt\n```",

It uses the `SupportedAttryTypes` tuple to dispatch the `do_it` method based on the type of the input value (`x`). If the type matches one of the supported types, it applies the `Op` function and returns the result; otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the remaining types.\n\n**is_cout_able Template**\n\nThe code defines an `is_cout_able` template that checks whether a given type can be output to a stream using the `<<` operator.
